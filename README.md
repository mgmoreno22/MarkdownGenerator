  ## Description
  This program will quickly generate a professional readme for a new project
  ## Installation
  npm install inquirer
  ## Usage
  After inquirer is installed, the user will respond to a series of prompts that will automatically generate a readme markdown file. The file will then be exported to the same folder of this program under the filename "README.md". Note: any file in this folder with the same filename will be overwritten including any additional generated readme files.
